 The project investigates the application of clustering methods and dimensionality reduction (DR)
algorithms for data preprocessing and employ these methods for training artificial neural networks to predict students success (dataset1) and diabetes risk (dataset2) . 
Six algorithms were used including two types of clustering 
algorithms namely K-means and expectation maximization (EM) and four dimensionality reduction 
algorithms namely principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), random 
projection (RP), and Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS). The datasets
